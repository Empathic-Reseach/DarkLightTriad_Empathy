### Title: **Building a New Template of Love Based on the "Women, Life, Freedom" Movement and Its Impact on Modern Feminism**

The "Women, Life, Freedom" movement in Iran represents a transformation in feminism and serves as a new template for love and human relationships. This movement emphasizes empathy, altruism, and compassion, aiming to create a supportive environment for women. In this article, we will analyze how to construct a new template of love inspired by this movement and compare it with older movements such as the Bhakti movement in India.

### Conceptual Framework

1. **Light Triad Characteristics**: The "Women, Life, Freedom" movement is built upon the characteristics of the light triad (empathy, altruism, and compassion). These traits not only help strengthen human relationships but also lay the groundwork for creating an empathetic and supportive community for women.

2. **Integration with Sternberg‚Äôs Love Theory**: By combining the characteristics of the light triad with Robert Sternberg's triangular theory of love (intimacy, passion, and commitment), deeper and more sustainable emotional relationships can be established within this movement. This integration enhances solidarity and cooperation among movement participants.

3. **Ultra Light Triad Personality**: The concept of an ultra light triad personality refers to an elevated state of these traits, empowered through mutual support and sacrifice. This dynamic can motivate individuals to work toward common goals while nurturing personal relationships that are both intimate and committed.

4. **Cultural Resonance**: Similar to the Bhakti movement in Hinduism, which is rooted in cultural and social values, the "Women, Life, Freedom" movement also draws from Iranian cultural values that promote cooperation and collective action.

### Table: Comparison of Characteristics

| Characteristics               | "Women, Life, Freedom" Movement | Bhakti Movement in India     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Emphasis on Empathy**       | Yes                              | Yes                          |
| **Focus on Altruism**         | Yes                              | Yes                          |
| **Sacrifice for the Collective Good** | Yes                      | Yes                          |
| **Emphasis on Romantic Love**  | Yes                              | Less                         |
| **Integration of Science and Technology** | Yes                  | Less                         |

### Risks of Misunderstanding Love

1. **Confusing Love with Dependency**: As with other movements, some individuals may confuse love with dependency, leading to unhealthy relationships. In such cases, individuals might feel unable to continue life without their partner, indicating emotional unhealthiness.

2. **Lack of Awareness of Different Types of Love**: Insufficient awareness of various types of love and their combinations can lead to dissatisfaction and frustration in relationships. For example, expecting a friendship to quickly evolve into consummate love may be unrealistic.

3. **Lack of Proper Education**: Inadequate education about love and emotional relationships can create misunderstandings and inappropriate behaviors in relationships. Education about different types of love and their dynamics can help individuals establish healthier connections.

### Importance of Understanding Love in Iranian Culture

In Iranian culture, love is recognized not only as an emotional feeling but also as a social phenomenon. Great poets like **Hafez** and **Rumi** have introduced love as a transformative force in human life. Therefore, understanding love correctly can help us create better human and social relationships.

### Conclusion

Building a new template of love based on the "Women, Life, Freedom" movement can help establish more sustainable and healthier relationships. This template emphasizes empathy, altruism, and compassion not only benefits individuals but also enriches society as a whole. Additionally, integrating science and technology into this process can enhance these values.
